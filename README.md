# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my github Profile!

Hi there, I'm **Haya**, a passionate **Software Developer** with a love for solving problems and building efficient, scalable solutions. I started my career as a **Web Designer**, working on **front-end development** and creating user-friendly, responsive web applications. Over time, I've expanded my expertise to include **backend technologies** and **API integration**, particularly in **C#** and **.NET Core**.

## ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm:
- Diving into **C#** and **.NET Core** for backend development.
- Learning and implementing **API integrations** with **OpenAI's APIs**.
- Exploring **prompt engineering** and **LLMs (Large Language Models)**, which is an exciting new area for me!
- Expanding my full-stack skills to create better, more innovative applications.

## ðŸ’¼ My Tech Stack:
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: C#, .NET Core
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs, OpenAI's APIs
- **Others**: Git, Version Control, Agile Development

## âœ¨ Fun Fact:
I'm a **Potterhead** who loves reading and watching **Harry Potter** and discussing theories about the wizarding world. Also, a fan of **Pakistani** and **English series** with great inspiring stories or just a good watch!

## ðŸš€ Looking Forward To:
- Learning more about **AI integrations** and applying **LLMs** in real-world projects.
- Building more robust applications that are both user-friendly and efficient.

Feel free to connect with me! Iâ€™m always excited to learn, collaborate, and share knowledge with the community.
